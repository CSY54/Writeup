# [Forensics] Zero  - (50 pts)

## Description

This file seems to be too large given how much text it contains, but I can find zero evidence of the flag. Maybe you'll have better luck than me?

## Solution

After a while of searching for the unicode character code, I found it's a kind of steganography using zero-width characters.

You can use [this site](https://330k.github.io/misc_tools/unicode_steganography.html) to get the output.

Flag `utflag{whyNOT@sc11_4927aajbqk14}`
